###How to create a new version?
Once the new version is ready you can push it to "src\versions" in our github repository.After finishing the development process make sure there are no bugs that you are aware of. In addition, we expect from the developer to number the versions.

###How to get a bug from the bug list?
The developers can review our bug list from the "issues page" in github.
If you want to start working on a bug you would have to assign yourself with the issue or ask a manager with a permission to assign it for you.
